# Building Weather App

The first thing to understand is how do we get the weather data? To get the data, we are dependent on a third-party service. We will use a website called OpenWeatherMap. OpenWeatherMap is a service that provides various weather data through API. We can integrate the API into our app and can use the data on our website. An API is like a waiter, it works as a medium between the server and the client to serve the data to the client according to the client's request.
