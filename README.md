# Random Color Generator

Colors are a crucial part of design, both online and offline. Almost all elements on a webpage have some color applied to them. There are entire websites built around creating gradients and color palettes either randomly or from a source color.
JavaScript does have a Math.random() function that we can use to generate those random numbers. It will give a random floating-point.
## Deployment
